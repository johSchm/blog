title: 'NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies for Solving a Two-Stage Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problem: A Comparison of Different Solution Strategies'
abstract: 'The article investigates the application of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to generate and parameterize artificial neural networks (ANN) on determining allocation and sequencing decisions in a two-stage hybrid flow shop scheduling environment with family setup times. NEAT is a machine-learning and neural architecture search algorithm, which generates both, the structure and the hyper-parameters of an ANN. Our experiments show that NEAT can compete with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of solution quality and outperforms them regarding computational efficiency. The main contributions of this article are: (i) A comparison of five different strategies, evaluated with 14 different experiments, on how ANNs can be applied for solving allocation and sequencing problems in a hybrid flow shop environment, (ii) a comparison of the best identified NEAT strategy with traditional heuristic and metaheuristic approaches concerning solution quality and computational efficiency.'
